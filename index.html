            <h1>About Parakeets</h1>
            <br>
            <p>A parakeet is any one of many small- to medium-sized species of parrot, in multiple genera, that generally has long tail feathers. The name parakeet is derived from the French word perroquet, which is reflected in some older spellings that are still sometimes encountered, including paroquet or paraquet.</p>

         <p> According to Wikipedia Parakeets comprise about 115 species of birds that are seed-eating parrots of small size, slender build, and long, tapering tails.[citation needed] The Australian budgerigar, also known as "budgie", Melopsittacus undulatus, is probably the most common parakeet. It was first described by zoologists in 1891. It is the most popular species of parakeet kept as a pet in North America and Europe. A rose-ringed parakeet (Psittacula krameri).
            The term "grass parakeet" (or grasskeet) refers to many small Australian parakeets native to grasslands such as the genus Neophema and the princess parrot. The Australian rosellas are also parakeets. Many of the smaller, long-tailed species of lories may be referred to as "lorikeets". The vernacular name ring-necked parakeet (not to be confused with the Australian ringneck) refers to a species of the genus Psittacula native to Africa and Asia that is popular as a pet and has become feral in many cities outside its natural range.
            In aviculture, the term "conure" is used for small to medium-sized parakeets of the genera Aratinga, Pyrrhura, and a few other genera of the tribe Arini, which are mainly endemic to South America. As they are not all from one genus, taxonomists tend to avoid the term. Other South American species commonly called parakeets include the genus Brotogeris parakeets, the monk parakeet, and lineolated parakeets, although lineolateds have short tails.
            A larger species may be referred to as "parrot" or "parakeet" interchangeably. For example, "Alexandrine parrot" and "Alexandrine parakeet" are two common names for the same species, Psittacula eupatria, which is one of the largest species normally referred to as a parakeet.
            Many different species of parakeets are bred and sold commercially as pets, the budgerigar being the third most popular pet in the world, after cats and dogs.

            <p>Parakeets are popular pets, but they're found in the wild, too. Parakeet species can be found in tropical and subtropical regions all over the world. Common parakeets are native to Australia. They prefer to stay away from the coastline, in arid, semi-arid, and sub-humid climates.  They can most often be found in farmland and riverine woodland, often in plants like dry mallee, mulga scrub, and spinifex. Wild common parrots have been introduced to Florida and have a population of about 3,000 there.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Parakeets average a lifespan of 10 to 15 years, but some may live longer. Common parakeets are monogamous. They don’t have a specific breeding season but often breed when seeds are abundant. They’ll make their nests in pre-existing holes in trees, logs, and fence posts, building them out of materials like droppings, decayed wood, and other soft material. The female parakeet will lay her eggs a day or two after mating. She typically lays an egg every other day, and in total will have between four and nine eggs per clutch. The eggs hatch in 18 to 20 days, and the female parakeet will stay with them the entire time while the male forages for food.</p>

        <h1 class="life">What Makes Some Parakeets Live Longer Than Others?</h1>
        <p>
            Multiple factors can influence how long a parakeet can live. Good husbandry is essential—if a parakeet does not have good husbandry provided for it, then their lifespan can be drastically shortened.
            
            Nutrition is another important factor. There are many different parakeet diets available, and a balanced diet is necessary to help your budgie live a complete life.

            <h1>Diet of Parakeets</h1>
            <p>Parakeets are granivores, meaning they only eat grain and seed. Grain and seed diets in captivity are not the same as in the wild. Wild parakeets often graze on grass seeds, chenopod seeds, and grain crops. Although all seed diets are readily available for parakeets, many of them do not provide the proper protein, vitamins, and minerals to help parakeets live long lives.

                Parakeets can develop numerous nutritional diseases when provided an imbalanced diet. Many seed diets do not have adequate calcium and vitamin A levels. A pelleted balanced diet is recommended to prevent any nutritional diseases. Seeds and millet can be used as behavioral enrichment to promote grazing behaviors.</p>
